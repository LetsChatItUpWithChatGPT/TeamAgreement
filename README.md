## Conflict Plan

   What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
    
  - Approach the conflict respectfully with psychological safety in mind.  Figure out where the root of the problem or concern is coming from and figure out a plan to resolve it.

   What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
    
   - Come together as a team and inform that individual how their actions are affecting the team as whole.  Try to come up with a better way to break up the work into sections to prevent someone from
     hijacking the entire project.
     
   How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    
   - Utilize each other's strengths in different areas of coding.  We all are on different levels in different areas and helping one another in those weaker areas is what will increase our learning across the board and help us navigate through all the different challenges.

   How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    
   - Set realistic expectations for each other on how we will contribute and at a reasonable pace.  We are developers, but we are still learning a lot of things we will be working with.  So keeping that in mind with how we model who is doing what, will help prevent this.

   How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
   - Since we are on such a short time period to accomplish our project, if something has not been able to resolved within a 24 hour period, we will reach out to our instructor, Ryan Gallaway, for assistance in navigating through the problem.

## Communication Plan

   What hours will you be available to communicate?
   
   - Given we are on varying time zones with some of us actually into the next day due to this, we will be trying to stay within our normal core hours that everyone has already worked out in their lives to be available.
   
   What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
   
   - We will primarily be using Slack for group communication, we have created our own group chat.
   
   How often will you take breaks?
   
   - We plan to stay in line with our class breaks.
   
   What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
   
   - If we begin to fall behind, we will look at what is pulling the project behind our deadline and come together to either address the problem together or adjust what our MVP is going to be.
   
   How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
   
   - We will respect each other's established work times that we agreed to upon the project start.
   
   What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
   
   - Daily meetings and pair programming rotations as features are completed.
   
   How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
   
   - Keep the psychological safety standards we learned in our previous class in mind at all portions of development.  Our daily meetings will allow for everyone to voice their concerns or plans for the day and hopefully it'll allow for us to be able connect on a personal level as well.

## Work Plan
 
  How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  
  - We will use our project board to generate TODOs and allow for us to keep track of how long different features will be taking and where we might need to push more resources in to.
  
  What project management tool will be used?
  
  - We will be using GitHub project board so we have all of our tracking board and repos in the same location.
